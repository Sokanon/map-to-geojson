# Market Analysis & Commercial Viability

## Executive Summary

**Verdict: Viable niche SaaS opportunity**

The product sits at the intersection of two growing markets: GIS software ($14B) and AI document processing ($3B). Its sweet spot is users who need GIS output but lack GIS expertise — a large, underserved segment.

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)

### Primary Markets

| Urban Planning Departments | 30,000+ | 5-15 | 150K-450K |
| Property Management | 200,000+ | 2-5 | 400K-1M |

**Conservative TAM**: 1-4M potential users globally

### Pricing Benchmarks

| Competitor | Pricing | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| QGIS | Free | Complex, steep learning curve |
| Maptitude | $695 one-time | Desktop only |
| GIS Cloud | $3,890/year | Full GIS platform |
| Bunting Labs | Enterprise (est. $5K+/year) | AI vectorization |
| Felt | $25-50/user/month | Collaborative mapping |
| Scribble Maps | $14/month | Basic features |

**Opportunity**: $29-99/month per seat for a focused tool

## Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

Realistic targets in Year 1-3:

| Tier | Description | Est. Size | Willingness to Pay |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Early Adopters | Tech-forward real estate, proptech | 10K-50K | High ($50-100/mo) |
| Mid-Market | Regional developers, planning consultants | 50K-200K | Medium ($30-50/mo) |
| SMB | Small architecture firms, local planners | 200K-500K | Price sensitive ($15-30/mo) |

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

**Bunting Labs** (buntinglabs.com)
- AI vectorization for plan sets, as-builts, utility maps
- Enterprise pricing (not published)
- Well-funded, targeting large contracts
- *Differentiator*: They focus on engineering drawings; you could focus on real estate masterplans

**Felt** (felt.com)
- Collaborative GIS platform
- $25-50/user/month
- More general purpose, not digitization-focused
- *Differentiator*: They're a GIS platform; you're a digitization tool

### Indirect Competitors

**QGIS** — Free but complex. 4-6 weeks to become proficient. Your tool's simplicity is a major advantage.

**Manual outsourcing** — Fiverr/Upwork digitization: $20-100 per map. At 5+ maps/month, your tool pays for itself.

**In-house GIS teams** — $80-150/hr specialists. Expensive, slow, creates bottlenecks.

## Go-to-Market Options

### Option A: Vertical SaaS (Recommended)
Focus on one vertical first (e.g., real estate masterplans).

**Pros**: Clear messaging, focused features, easier sales
**Cons**: Smaller initial market

**Pricing**: $49/month (starter) — $199/month (team)

### Option B: Horizontal Tool
Market as general "map digitizer" across all verticals.

**Pros**: Larger market
**Cons**: Harder to differentiate, compete with Bunting Labs

### Option C: Self-Hosted License
Sell perpetual licenses for on-premise deployment.

**Pros**: Higher ticket ($2,000-10,000), appeals to enterprises with security concerns
**Cons**: Support burden, slower sales cycle

### Option D: Open Core
Free self-hosted, paid cloud with collaboration features.

**Pros**: Community growth, freemium funnel
**Cons**: Slower revenue, risk of never converting

## Revenue Projections (Conservative)

Assuming Option A, real estate focus:

| Year | Customers | ARPU/mo | MRR | ARR |
|------|-----------|---------|-----|-----|
| Y1 | 100 | $75 | $7.5K | $90K |
| Y2 | 500 | $85 | $42.5K | $510K |
| Y3 | 1,500 | $100 | $150K | $1.8M |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- Unique boundary-color selection algorithm
- AI OCR integration (differentiator vs QGIS)
- Modern tech stack, easy to iterate
- Self-hostable (enterprise appeal)
- Simple UX vs complex GIS tools

### Weaknesses
- No georeferencing (can't place on real-world coordinates yet)
- Single developer (bus factor)
- No existing customer base
- Limited to raster → vector (no vector editing)

### Opportunities
- ArcMap being phased out in 2026 creates migration opportunity
- Growing proptech sector needs map digitization
- AI hype increases willingness to pay for AI-powered tools
- Potential for API/integration plays (feed data into property management systems)

### Threats
- Bunting Labs expanding into your niche
- QGIS adding simplified mode
- Large players (Esri, Google) adding AI digitization
- Economic downturn affecting real estate

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Validate demand**: Talk to 20 potential customers (real estate developers, architects). Do they have this pain? Would they pay $50-100/month?

2. **Add killer feature**: Georeferencing (assign real-world coordinates) would unlock GIS integration use cases

3. **Build landing page**: Capture emails, test messaging, run small ad campaign ($500) to gauge interest

4. **Launch on Product Hunt / HN**: Free exposure to early adopters

5. **Consider API-first**: Offer the magic-wand + OCR as an API. Developers pay per call. Lower friction than full SaaS.

## Bottom Line

**Is it sellable?** Yes, with focus.

The tool solves a real problem (manual digitization is slow/expensive) better than free alternatives (QGIS is complex) and cheaper than enterprise solutions (Bunting Labs, ArcGIS).

Best path: Vertical SaaS targeting real estate developers who need to digitize masterplans. Land 5-10 paying customers to validate, then decide whether to scale or pivot.

**Risk level**: Medium. Market exists, product works, but execution and distribution are the hard parts.
